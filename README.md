# Clicky-Game

## Overview

This is a memory game using React.

### Instructions

1. Create a new React application using Create React App.

2. The app should render 10 different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

<img width="1280" alt="homeScreen" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46056178/59969014-09ed3000-9512-11e9-9edc-9fac221e2527.png">

3. The app should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
